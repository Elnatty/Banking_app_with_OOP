1 --> Abstraction: exposing only the necessary details needed by whoever will use the program.

2 --> Inheritance: allows for code re-usability, ie: creating a new class, that uses the features of an existing class
      but you want to add more features to it. (sub or extended or child class), from (super or base or parent).

3 --> Polymorphism: allows you to determine what kind of function to run while the program is running.
4 --> Encapsulation: restricting access of certain properties or methods of our objects to whatever is calling that object.
